	<h2>Code Next Programs</h2><h6>(At least the ones I am in)</h6>
	<p>Code Next has many programs that you can join that can lead into other programs.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Foundations</h3></li>
		<p>Code Next Foundations is the beginning of it all. You will have to go to Foundations to get accepted into the next Google programs. Foundations teaches you coding, leadership, and stratagy. It will teach you things that will come in handy if you choose to go into a technology based career. A lot of these tactics can even apply to everyday life.</p>
		<p>These next programs are where most of the tactics you have just learned come into play.</p>
		<li><h3>Team Edge</h3></li>
		<p>Team Edge is a program that only the best of Foundations get into. You are supplied with a MacBook from Google. Team Edge takes it to the next level with coding. You learn to code even more and even learn a little animating. You learn to use html, css, and javascript. Literlly, this website is made from the html we are learning.
